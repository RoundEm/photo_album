# Personal Photoghraphy App

## Tech 
- Next.js / React
- Pure React Carousel
- React Photo Gallery
- Styled Components 
- Cloudinary Admin & Search APIs

## TODOs
- Fix weird issue where you can see a small sliver of the previous/next carousel images
- Move positioning of all carousel buttons relative to contained image width
- Add more style to carousel
- Add image numbers to carousel (e.g. 3/7)
- Format dates differently (also maybe just show month and year??)
- Find out how to sort or reorder images in Cloudinary by order pictures were taken or sort by time pictures were taken (is this only possible with paid plan??)
- Ask Cloudinary if there's a way to get folder paths without using the Admin API
- Add image loading placeholder
- Add UI loader for when returning to main page from album
